For example, for a 25% discount on a $100 item: $100 × 0.25 = $25 (discount amount), then $100 - $25 = $75 (final price). Alternatively, you can multiply the original price by (1 minus the discount percentage): $100 × (1 - 0.25) = $100 × 0.75 = $75. For quick mental math, remember that 10% is easy to calculate (just move the decimal point), and you can use that as a building block (e.g., 25% = 10% + 10% + 5%).'

              'text': 'While often used interchangeably in retail, discount and markdown have distinct technical meanings. A discount is a temporary reduction in price, typically as part of a promotion or sale event, with the expectation that the item will return to its original price later. Examples include seasonal sales, loyalty discounts, or coupons. A markdown is a permanent reduction in price, often applied to move aging inventory or reflect decreased value. From an accounting perspective, discounts are typically reported separately from regular sales, while markdowns are absorbed into the cost of goods sold. For consumers, the practical effect is identical—both result in paying less than the original price.'

              'text': 'To find the original price when you know the sale price and discount percentage, divide the sale price by (1 minus the discount percentage as a decimal). For example, if an item costs $60 after a 25% discount, the original price would be: $60 ÷ (1 - 0.25) = $60 ÷ 0.75 = $80. This calculation works because the sale price is effectively the original price multiplied by (1 - discount percentage). The formula works for any discount percentage, allowing you to verify if advertised "original prices" in stores are accurate. This calculation is particularly useful during sales when only the discounted price and discount percentage are displayed.'

For example, with a 20% discount followed by an additional 10% off, the total discount isn\'t 30%. Instead: Original price × (1 - 0.2) × (1 - 0.1) = Original price × 0.8 × 0.9 = Original price × 0.72, representing a 28% total discount. To calculate the equivalent single discount percentage from multiple discounts, subtract the product of (1 - each discount rate) from 1. For three discounts of 20%, 10%, and 5%: 1 - [(1 - 0.2) × (1 - 0.1) × (1 - 0.05)] = 1 - [0.8 × 0.9 × 0.95] = 1 - 0.684 = 31.6% total effective discount.'

The psychology behind pricing is also important—items priced at $19.99 rather than $20.00 appear more affordable (charm pricing), and discounts presented as "Get $20 off" often perform better than equivalent percentage discounts for higher-priced items.'
