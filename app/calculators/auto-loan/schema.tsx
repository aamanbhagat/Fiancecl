              'text': 'A good interest rate for an auto loan depends on your credit score, loan term, and whether you\'re buying new or used. For new vehicles, excellent credit scores (720+) might qualify for rates between 3-4%, good credit (660-719) around 4-6%, and average credit (600-659) around 6-9%. Used car rates are typically 1-2% higher. Rates increase for longer terms, with 60-month loans being standard. Shop around and get pre-approved to ensure you\'re getting competitive rates.'

For example, if you earn $5,000 monthly, keep total car expenses under $500, with your loan payment being only part of that amount. This guideline helps ensure your car doesn\'t become a financial burden and protects against depreciation.'

Shorter terms (36-48 months) mean higher monthly payments but substantially lower total interest costs and less risk of negative equity. Longer terms (72-84 months) reduce monthly payments but dramatically increase total interest paid and keep you in debt longer. For example, on a $30,000 loan at 5% APR, a 60-month term costs $3,060 in interest versus $4,356 for 84 months—a 42% increase—while only reducing the monthly payment from $551 to $409.'

              'text': 'A larger down payment (20%+ of vehicle price) offers several advantages: it reduces your loan amount and monthly payments, may qualify you for better interest rates, provides immediate equity in the vehicle, and protects against depreciation. New vehicles typically lose 20-30% of value in the first year, so a significant down payment helps prevent owing more than the car is worth (negative equity). This is particularly important if you might need to sell or trade in the vehicle before paying off the loan.'
