Depreciation is the difference between the vehicle\'s negotiated price (adjusted capitalized cost) and its expected value at lease end (residual value), divided by the number of months in the lease. The finance charge is calculated by multiplying the money factor (interest rate equivalent) by the sum of the adjusted capitalized cost and residual value. Sales tax is then applied to the payment according to your local tax laws.'

For example, a money factor of 0.00125 equals a 3% APR (0.00125 Ã— 2400 = 3%). A lower money factor means a lower finance charge on your lease. Consumers with excellent credit typically qualify for money factors equivalent to 1-3% APR.'

A higher residual value percentage means the vehicle is expected to retain more of its value, which reduces the depreciation amount you pay during the lease and results in lower monthly payments. Luxury vehicles and models known for reliability often have higher residual values than average vehicles.'
