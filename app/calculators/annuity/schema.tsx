An annuity due features payments at the beginning of each period, which is typical for leases and insurance premiums. Annuity due typically results in slightly higher present and future values because payments are made earlier, allowing for additional time for interest to compound.'

For example, a $2,000 monthly annuity payment would have the purchasing power of only $1,107 after 20 years with 3% annual inflation. To combat this, consider inflation-protected annuities that provide increasing payments over time, though these start with lower initial payments.'

              'text': 'The tax treatment of annuities depends on how they\'re funded. Annuities purchased with qualified funds (IRA, 401(k)) result in payments that are fully taxable as ordinary income. Non-qualified annuities (purchased with after-tax money) generate partially taxable payments based on an exclusion ratio. Annuities funded through Roth IRAs may provide tax-free payments if annuitized after age 59Â½ and the account has been open for more than 5 years.'

Each type serves different needs and risk tolerances.'
