It\'s calculated by determining your gross estate (all assets owned at death), subtracting allowable deductions (debts, funeral expenses, charitable donations, and marital deductions), and then applying the exemption amount ($13.61 million per individual in 2025). Any value exceeding the exemption is taxed at graduated rates, with the top federal rate at 40%. The process involves: 1) Valuing all assets including real estate, financial accounts, businesses, and personal property; 2) Subtracting liabilities and deductions; 3) Applying the lifetime exemption; and 4) Calculating tax on the remaining taxable estate. The resulting tax must typically be paid within nine months of death.'

You may need to pay estate taxes if: 1) Your net estate exceeds the federal exemption amount; 2) You live in one of the 12 states with separate estate taxes, which often have lower exemptions (ranging from $1 million to matching the federal exemption); 3) You own property in a state with estate taxes, even if you don\'t reside there; or 4) You\'re a non-U.S. citizen with U.S. assets exceeding $60,000. Estate tax filing may be required even if no tax is due, particularly to claim portability of a deceased spouse\'s unused exemption amount.'

To optimize this benefit: 1) Assets must pass outright to the surviving spouse or to a qualifying trust; 2) The deduction doesn\'t apply to non-citizen spouses unless assets transfer to a Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT); 3) Portability allows the surviving spouse to claim the deceased spouse\'s unused exemption amount by filing Form 706 within 9 months of death (with possible 6-month extension); 4) Combined with proper trust planning, a married couple can effectively double their exemption amount. This deduction represents one of the most powerful estate tax planning tools available to married couples.'

The estate tax is levied on the deceased person\'s estate before assets are distributed to beneficiaries, with the estate itself responsible for paying the tax. In contrast, inheritance tax is paid by the individual beneficiaries who receive assets, with tax rates typically varying based on the beneficiary\'s relationship to the deceased. The federal government only imposes an estate tax, not an inheritance tax. However, six states (Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) collect inheritance taxes, with exemptions generally higher for close relatives. Maryland is the only state that collects both taxes. These distinctions are important for comprehensive estate planning across state lines.'
