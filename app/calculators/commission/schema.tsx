Each structure creates different incentives and risk profiles. Our calculator handles all these variations to help you understand your potential earnings.'

              'text': 'Tiered commissions increase your commission rate as you reach higher sales thresholds. For example, a tiered structure might pay 5% on the first $25,000 in sales, 7% on sales between $25,001 and $50,000, and 10% on everything above $50,000. These can be calculated in two ways: total volume tiers (higher rate applies to all sales once a threshold is reached) or marginal tiers (higher rates only apply to amounts above each threshold). Tiered structures incentivize high performance by significantly increasing earnings potential for top performers. On average, moving up one tier can increase commission earnings by 20-40%.'

              '@type': 'Answer',
              'text': 'Commissions are taxed as ordinary income, but withholding works differently than for regular salary. The IRS considers commissions \"supplemental wages\" and provides two withholding methods: 1) The percentage method - withholding a flat 22% federal tax rate; or 2) The aggregate method - combining commission with regular wages to determine withholding. While 22% is withheld initially, your actual tax rate may be higher or lower depending on total annual income. Self-employed commission workers must pay both employee and employer portions of FICA taxes (15.3% total) and make quarterly estimated tax payments. Proper tax planning is essential for commission-based workers to avoid underpayment penalties or surprises at tax time.'

Average rates include: Real Estate (5-6% split between agents), Insurance (15-20% first-year commissions for life insurance, 7-15% for property and casualty), Automotive Sales (2-3% of sale price or 25-30% of dealer profit), Financial Services (0.25-1% for financial advisors managing assets, 3-5% for mortgage brokers), Software Sales (7-15% for SaaS products), Retail (2-15% depending on product category), and Manufacturing Reps (5-15% for industrial equipment). Rates also vary based on company size, with startups often offering higher commission percentages to attract talent while established companies may offer lower rates but higher overall compensation through base salary and benefits.'

              '@type': 'Answer',
              'text': 'A draw against commission is an advance that provides stable income during slow periods or when building a client base. There are two main types: 1) Recoverable draw - functions as a loan that must be repaid from future commissions, creating potential debt if sales targets aren\'t met; and 2) Non-recoverable draw - serves as a guaranteed minimum compensation that doesn\'t need repayment if commissions fall short. Draws typically reset monthly or quarterly. For example, with a $3,000 monthly recoverable draw, if you earn $4,000 in commissions, you\'d receive an additional $1,000; if you earn only $2,000, you\'d carry a $1,000 deficit into the next period. This arrangement helps balance income stability with performance incentives.'
