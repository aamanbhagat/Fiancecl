This occurs because new bonds will be issued with higher coupon rates when market rates increase, making existing bonds with lower coupons less attractive unless their prices decrease. For example, if you hold a 3% coupon bond and market rates rise to 4%, your bond\'s value will decrease to compensate buyers for the lower coupon. This relationship is quantified by metrics like duration, which indicates price sensitivity to rate changes.'

Yield to maturity (YTM) is more comprehensive, calculating the total return expected if the bond is held until maturity, including coupon payments, capital gains/losses from price changes, and the time value of money. For example, a $950 bond with a $1,000 face value and $50 annual coupon has a current yield of 5.26% ($50/$950) but a higher YTM that accounts for the $50 gain at maturity.'

Specifically, modified duration indicates the approximate percentage change in a bond\'s price for a 1% change in interest rates. For example, a bond with a modified duration of 5 would be expected to decrease in value by approximately 5% if interest rates rise by 1%, or increase by 5% if rates fall by 1%. Longer-term bonds typically have higher durations, making them more volatile when rates change. Investors use duration to assess risk and immunize portfolios against interest rate movements.'

Conversely, a bond trades at a discount when its price is below face value, usually because its coupon rate is lower than market rates. For example, a $1,000 face value bond with a 5% coupon might trade for $1,050 (premium) when market rates drop to 4%, or $950 (discount) if rates rise to 6%. Premium bonds offer higher current income but lower yields to maturity, while discount bonds provide capital appreciation opportunity but less current income.'

              'text': 'Credit ratings significantly impact bond pricing through risk premiums. Bonds with high ratings (AAA, AA) from agencies like Moody\'s or S&P are considered safer investments and therefore command lower yields. Lower-rated bonds (BB, B, CCC) must offer higher yields to compensate investors for increased default risk. This yield difference is called the credit spread. For instance, if a 10-year Treasury bond yields 3%, an AAA-rated corporate bond might yield 3.5% (0.5% spread), while a BB-rated "junk" bond could yield 6% (3% spread). As a bond\'s credit rating changes, its price adjusts to align with the appropriate yield for its new risk level.'
