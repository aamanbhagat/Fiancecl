For example, a 1% increase in interest rates can boost monthly payouts by 8-10%. When rates rise, insurance companies can offer better payouts since they can earn more on their investments. Conversely, in low interest rate environments, annuity payouts tend to decrease. This is why timing your annuity purchase can substantially affect your retirement income.'

An annuity due features payments at the beginning of each period, which is typical for leases and insurance premiums. Annuity due typically results in slightly higher present and future values because payments are made earlier, allowing for additional time for interest to compound. The choice affects both the payment amount and overall return.'

              'text': 'Inflation represents one of the greatest threats to annuity income, particularly for fixed payouts that remain constant over decades while the cost of living increases. For example, a $2,000 monthly annuity payment would have the purchasing power of only $1,107 after 20 years with 3% annual inflation. To combat this, consider inflation-protected annuities that provide increasing payments over time, though these start with lower initial payments. Our calculator allows you to model the impact of inflation on your income.'

              'text': 'Several key factors determine your annuity payout amount: 1) Size of your premium/lump sum - larger investments generate more income; 2) Your age when payments begin - older ages generally yield higher payouts due to shorter life expectancy; 3) Interest rates - higher rates allow insurance companies to offer better payouts; 4) Payment options selected - features like joint life coverage or guaranteed periods reduce payouts; 5) Payout period - whether lifetime or fixed period; and 6) Inflation protection - adding inflation adjustment reduces initial payments but increases them over time.'
