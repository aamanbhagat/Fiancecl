APR, however, includes both the interest rate and additional costs such as origination fees, closing costs, mortgage insurance, and other charges. For example, a loan might have a 4% interest rate but a 4.5% APR once all fees are factored in. This makes APR a more complete representation of what you\'ll actually pay for the loan.'

Two loans might have the same interest rate, but vastly different APRs due to varying fee structures. For example, if Lender A offers a 5% interest rate with $3,000 in fees while Lender B offers 5.25% with $500 in fees, the APR would help determine which loan is truly less expensive over time. The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose APR precisely to help consumers make informed comparisons.'

              '@type': 'Answer',
              'text': 'Yes, APR can change during the life of a loan, particularly with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or credit cards. With ARMs, the interest rate can adjust periodically based on market indices, directly affecting the APR. For credit cards, the APR can change due to fluctuations in the prime rate, promotional period expirations, or if you miss payments. Fixed-rate mortgages and loans typically maintain the same APR throughout their term unless you refinance or experience a major change in loan terms.'
