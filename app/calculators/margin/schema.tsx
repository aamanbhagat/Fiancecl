              'text': 'Margin and markup are related pricing concepts that use different reference points. Margin (profit margin) is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost) ÷ Selling Price, expressed as a percentage of the selling price. Markup, however, is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost) ÷ Cost, expressed as a percentage of the cost. For example, if an item costs $80 and sells for $100, the margin is ($100 - $80) ÷ $100 = 20%, while the markup is ($100 - $80) ÷ $80 = 25%. This distinction is crucial because using them interchangeably leads to pricing errors. A 50% margin yields a selling price double the markup percentage (100% markup), while a 50% markup yields a smaller margin (33.3%). Retailers and manufacturers typically work with markup during purchasing and pricing decisions, then convert to margin when analyzing financial performance.'

              '@type': 'Answer',
              'text': 'To calculate selling price from cost and desired margin, use the formula: Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Desired Margin as decimal). For example, if a product costs $75 and you want a 40% profit margin, the calculation would be $75 ÷ (1 - 0.40) = $75 ÷ 0.60 = $125. This formula works because margin is defined as (Selling Price - Cost) ÷ Selling Price. By rearranging this equation, we get Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin). It\'s important to note that this formula uses margin (profit as percentage of selling price), not markup (profit as percentage of cost). If you\'re working with markup instead, the formula would be Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup as decimal). For a 40% markup on a $75 item, the selling price would be $75 × 1.40 = $105, resulting in a lower selling price than using a 40% margin.'

Average gross profit margins by sector include: Retail (particularly grocery stores): 25-35% with net margins often below 5%; Restaurants: 60-70% gross margins but just 3-5% net margins due to high operational costs; Technology: Software companies often enjoy 70-90% gross margins with 15-25% net margins; Professional services (consulting, legal): 50-70% gross margins; Manufacturing: 25-40% gross margins depending on product complexity; Healthcare: Hospitals typically see 7-10% net margins while pharmaceutical companies can reach 15-20%; Financial services: Banks average 30-35% net margins; Real estate: 15-30% net margins for property management. Within these industries, luxury segments typically command higher margins than budget segments. Companies should benchmark their margins against industry standards while understanding that higher volume businesses can thrive with lower margins, and newer businesses often operate with tighter margins while establishing market presence.'

              'text': 'The three main profit margin metrics measure different aspects of business profitability: Gross margin represents the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting direct costs of goods sold (COGS), calculated as (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue. It measures production and service delivery efficiency. Operating margin goes further by also subtracting operating expenses like rent, payroll, and marketing, calculated as (Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses) ÷ Revenue. It measures operational efficiency and pricing effectiveness. Net margin (bottom line) deducts all expenses including taxes and interest, calculated as Net Income ÷ Revenue. It shows the percentage of each revenue dollar that becomes profit. For example, a business with $1M revenue, $600K COGS, $200K operating expenses, and $50K in interest and taxes would have: 40% gross margin ($400K/$1M), 20% operating margin ($200K/$1M), and 15% net margin ($150K/$1M). Each metric offers different insights—gross margin reflects production efficiency, operating margin shows operational management, and net margin demonstrates overall profitability including financing decisions and tax strategies.'
