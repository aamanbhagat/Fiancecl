## Implementation Pattern

For each calculator, add:

### 1. Import Statement
```tsx
import { SaveCalculationButton } from "@/components/save-calculation-button"
```

### 2. Component Placement
Add before the closing `</Card>` tag of the results section:

```tsx
<SaveCalculationButton
  calculatorType="calculator-name"
  inputs={{
    // All input state variables
    inputVar1,
    inputVar2,
    // etc...
  }}
  results={{
    // All calculated results
    result1,
    result2,
    // etc...
  }}
/>
```
